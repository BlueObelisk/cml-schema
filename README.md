Chemical Markup Language Schema
===============================

This Git repository holds the latest Chemical Markup Language XML Schema specification. It is based on the CML Schema 3 available from: http://www.xml-cml.org/schema/

Examples of CML 3 can be found here: http://www.xml-cml.org/examples/schema24/

Authors
-------

I cannot do justice to all author, but clearly the inventors and leads are:

Peter Murray-Rust, Henry Rzepa

But many more have contributed to the development and maintenance of CML, including
at least Jim Downing.
